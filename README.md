# google-homepage

Write a brief introduction for what the current project is and what skills you
have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can do this as a
self-reflection at the end of the project which is a good way to revise what
you have learned.)

This project is a copy of Google's homepage using only HTML, CSS, and git (for
pushing this project on to Github).
